The version number is four digits:

1. Major number. Now it is 2.
In the near future the number change is not planned.

2. Minor number. 
Is incremented when only minor features or significant 
fixes have been added.
While maintaining compatibility with previous versions.

3. .NET Framework version.
 
For example:
35 - .NET Framework 3.5
4  - .NET Framework 4
45 - .NET Framework 4.5

Now it's only 4 - .NET Framework 4.0.

4. Revision number in local revision control system.
Do not pay attention to it.
